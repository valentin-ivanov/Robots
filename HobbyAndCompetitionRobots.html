<p><img src="hexbug.png" style="float:right; width: 20em">Hobby robots are robots which have been created for fun. An example of this type of robot would be a line follower,
    hexbug, robo-fish,etc. Usually these types of robots are built for children to play with
    but some people make the robots themselves. A competition is a robot which has been created for competition. 
    These types of robot are created to battle each other. A very simple competition robot is a sumo-bot. A sumo-bot is a simple robot because he only has to wheels and a ram.
    A more complicated robot would have saws handles and even flame throwers. There is a very famous competition TV series in 
    America called <a href="http://battlebots.com/" target="_blank">BattleBots</a>/p>
